# Eviction Free NYC!

This site was built in conjunction with the [Right to Counsel Coalition](https://www.righttocounselnyc.org/) as a new resource for NYC tenants to navigate the new RTC law, learn how to respond to an eviction notice, and access legal aid services.

### Getting the site up-and-running

This site is built on top of [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Once you clone the repo, make sure that you have `node >= v6` and `npm >= v3` running. In a terminal window, type `node --version` and hit ENTER, then `npm --version` and hit ENTER to get this info. You'll then need to install gatsby:

```
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```
alternatively in [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):
```
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

Once your environment is setup, you'll need to download libraries (make sure you're in the root directory):
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```
then simply use the Gatsby CLI to start your dev environment!
```
gatsby develop
```
